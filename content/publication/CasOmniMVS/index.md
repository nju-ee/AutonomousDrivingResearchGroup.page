abstract: Estimating 360Â° depth from multiple cameras has been a challenging problem. However, existing methods often adopt a fixed-step spherical sweeping approach with densely sampled spheres and use numerous 3D convolutions in networks, which limits the speed of algorithms in practice. Additionally, obtaining high-precision depth maps of real scenes poses a challenge for the existing algorithms. In this paper, we design a cascade architecture using a dynamic spherical sweeping method that progressively refines the depth estimation from coarse to fine over multiple stages. The proposed method adaptively adjusts sweeping intervals and ranges based on the predicted depth and the uncertainty from the previous stage, resulting in a more efficient cost aggregation performance. The experimental results demonstrated that our method achieved state-of-the-art accuracy with reduced GPU memory usage and time consumption compared to the other methods. Furthermore, we illustrate that our method achieved satisfactory performance on real-world data, despite being trained on synthetic data, indicating its generalization potential and practical applicability.
